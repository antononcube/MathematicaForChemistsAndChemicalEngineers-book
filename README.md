# Mathematica for Chemists and Chemical Engineers

This repository is for code, book chapters, and project management files for the book "Mathematica for Chemists and Chemical Engineers".

***The book is not finished yet -- it is a work in progress...***

## Mission statement

This book has a couple of goals.

### First goal

The first is to give introduction to functional programming (and Mathematica) to people with 
experimental chemistry and chemical engineering back- ground. 

All programming constructs and algorithms are going to be explained with block-schemes, 
which would make them easier to comprehend for people who are accustomed to follow charts of reaction flows 
and technological processes (i.e. experimental chemists and chemical engineers). 

To my knowledge, this is not a common way to explain Mathematica and functional programming, 
but in my experience it is very successful when used with chemists.

### Second goal

The second is to introduce certain powerful mathematical and algorithmic concepts 
that applied in chemical settings give important and interesting tools for chemical research, investigation, and engineering.

This book would attempt to give a solid background and direction in using Mathematica 
in chemical computational tasks that arise in mathematical chemistry, computational chemistry, cheminformatics, 
combinatorial chemistry, and chemometrics.

Another way to look at this book is as a source of examples of mathematical concepts and algorithms 
applied to chemical problems for chemists, mathematicians, and computer scientists who want to see them.

## Programming languages

The programming languages used are 
[Wolfram Language (WL)](https://www.wolfram.com/language/) 

("Wolfram Language" and "Mathematica" are used as synonyms in this book.)

All code is available at the repository [MathematicaForChemistry](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForChemistry). 

## Exposition plan

This [document](./Ideation/Mathematical-Treatement-of-Chemical-Problems.pdf) has a preliminary exposition plan.

See this [mind-map](./Ideation/Mathematica-for-Chemists-and-Chemical-Engineers-mind-map.pdf)
or 
this [org-mode file]()
for a more detailed order of book's parts and chapters.

## Who is the intended reader?

- Students of chemistry, environmental pollution, or applied mathematics.

- Chemists or chemical engineers who want to learn programming (using a functional programming language.)

- Researchers in computational chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and environmental pollution.
