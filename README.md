# Mathematica for Chemists and Chemical Engineers

This repository is for code, book chapters, and project management files for the book "Mathematica for Chemists and Chemical Engineers".

***The book is not finished yet -- it is a work in progress...***

## Mission statement

The purpose of this book is to give an overview and examples of different philosophical and mathematical methodologies 
and software programming techniques that would allow the reader to practice Data Science
almost as successfully as seasoned practitioners, who have solid backgrounds in Statistics or Machine Learning. 
(Or better than them.)

## Programming languages

The programming languages used are 
[Wolfram Language (WL)](https://www.wolfram.com/language/) 

("Wolfram Language" and "Mathematica" are used as synonyms in this book.)

All code is available at the repository [MathematicaForChemistry](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForChemistry). 

## Exposition plan

This [document]() has a preliminary exposition plan.
