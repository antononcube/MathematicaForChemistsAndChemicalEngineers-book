* Introduction
- This document lists the principles to be followed while writing and editing the chapters of the book "Mathematica for Chemists and Chemical Engineers".
* Book parts
- Three main parts are considered related to the main /new to chemists/ content:
  - Computer Science
  - Machine Learning
  - Mathematical / theoretical
* Chapter themes
- Which chapters form a "theme of learning".
  - E.g. for a very specialized (mini) course.
- Topics that appear across the chapters.
* Chapter Exposition
** General
- "Inverted structure" for each chapter
  - Do not hold the punchline for chapter's end.
- Q&A style introduction
** Structure
- Introduction -- Q&A style 
- Formulation of the problem
  - The "big picture" for the problem
	- Context
	- Bigger or more complicated problem(s)
  - The problem that is /needed/ to be solved.
  - The problem relaxation or abstraction.
	- The problem we /choose/ to solve.
- Methods overview
  - To solve the problem
  - The one we /choose/ to use and present
- Theory of the method
- Implementation to Mathematica
- Further extensions
  - Readers to learn more about
  - Software wise
  - For the authors (future book versions)
- Further readings
- References
- Problems
* Code explanations 
- What is the code general code style?
- Clearly state where the packages used can be found.
- Clearly state where the find the notebooks corresponding to each chapter.
* Diagrams
- Many/most diagrams are made with Mathematica.
- The rest are made with [[http://tentouchapps.com/grafio/][Grafio]].
* Mathematica problems
- The Mathematica problems are relatively concise.
- All problems have solutions in separate notebooks available at [[https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaForChemistsAndChemicalEngineers-book][book's GitHub repository]].
